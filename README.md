# VBA-challenge
This VBA script loops through all the stocks(tickers) for each year(worksheet) and outputs the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year. It then converts this yearly change into a percentage. It also outputs the total volume of stock for each ticker. All of this information is then put into a summary table where you can easily see if the yearly change for each ticker was negative or positive because of the conditional formatting, changing the background colors to red(negative) or green(positive) depending on the outcome.

A second summary table is then created showing which ticker had the Greatest % Increase/Decrease and Greatest Total Volume from each year.
